Figuring out where I went wrong
The script not followed, then was awfully long
Too much pluck, too little of
The acting right, not acting up
I wore the world upon my back
Though someone else could meet, pick up the slack
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way

Now I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinking 'bout
Time is wasted looking back

The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on
